The MG996R servos are rated for a voltage range of **4.8V to 7.2V**, so your 7.4V LiPo battery is slightly above the recommended maximum voltage for the servos. To safely use your 7.4V LiPo battery with MG996R servos, you'll need to reduce the voltage to stay within the safe operating range of the servo.

Here are a couple of options to achieve this:

### 1. **Voltage Regulator**
   - Use a **5V or 6V voltage regulator** to step down the voltage from 7.4V to a safer level for the servo.
   - Linear regulators like the **LM7805** can output 5V, but they might dissipate heat if the current draw is high.
   - A more efficient option would be a **DC-DC buck converter**, which can step down the voltage with higher efficiency and less heat dissipation.

### 2. **BEC (Battery Eliminator Circuit)**
   - A **BEC** is commonly used in RC applications to regulate battery voltage. Many BECs allow you to set a fixed output voltage (often 5V or 6V) to power your servos while using a higher voltage battery.

### 3. **Servo Power Distribution Board**
   - If you're controlling multiple MG996R servos, a **servo power distribution board** with a built-in voltage regulator can distribute power from your battery to multiple servos while maintaining the appropriate voltage.

Make sure the solution you choose can supply enough current for the servos, as the MG996R can draw up to **2.5A** under stall conditions.

For a hexapod robot with 18 servos, power management is critical because all 18 MG996R servos can draw a significant amount of current, especially under load. Here's a breakdown of the best power solutions:

### 1. **High-Current BEC**
   A single, high-current BEC can power all 18 servos, ensuring stable voltage and sufficient current. Each MG996R can draw up to **2.5A** at stall, but normal operation is closer to **1-1.5A** per servo under moderate load. Assuming you won't run all servos at full stall at once, a BEC capable of supplying **15-20A** continuous current should be sufficient.

   - **Castle Creations 20A BEC Pro**
     - Input Voltage: 3S-12S LiPo (up to 50.4V)
     - Output Voltage: Adjustable from 4.8V to 12.5V
     - Output Current: 20A continuous, up to 30A peak
     - This BEC offers a high current output, with adjustable voltage to set it to 6V, which would work well with MG996R servos. This would ensure stable power for all 18 servos.

### 2. **Multiple BECs (Parallel)**
   Using multiple BECs to split the current load across the servos is another solution. You could, for example, divide the servos into 3 groups of 6 servos each, and use a separate BEC for each group.

   - **Hobbywing 5A UBEC (x3)**
     - Input Voltage: 5V to 26V
     - Output Voltage: 5V or 6V (selectable)
     - Output Current: 5A continuous, 7.5A peak
     - You can connect three of these UBECs to power different sections of your hexapod. Each UBEC could handle around 6 servos, providing a safer way to distribute power.

### 3. **Servo Power Distribution Board**
   This can simplify wiring and reduce the load on a single BEC by distributing power effectively across all 18 servos.

   - **Turnigy 20-Channel Power Distribution Board**
     - Input Voltage: 7V to 28V
     - Built-in 5V or 6V BEC
     - Output Current: Up to 30A total
     - This board is designed to handle many servos, making it a great fit for your hexapod robot. You can wire all 18 servos to this board and power it from a single LiPo battery, ensuring clean and organized power distribution.

### 4. **High-Capacity LiPo Battery**
   Since 18 servos draw a lot of current, you'll also need a high-capacity LiPo battery to ensure your robot operates for a reasonable time without frequent recharging. A **3S or 4S** LiPo with at least **5000mAh** capacity and a **C-rating** of **20C or higher** should work well, delivering enough current for your servos.

   - **3S 5000mAh LiPo Battery (20C)**
     - This battery can provide up to **100A** of continuous current (5000mAh x 20C = 100A), which is plenty to handle the demands of your servos, even under peak load.

### Conclusion
For your hexapod robot with 18 servos, the best solution would be to use a **Castle Creations 20A BEC Pro** or a **Turnigy 20-Channel Power Distribution Board** for clean power distribution. Pair this with a high-capacity LiPo battery like a 3S or 4S, 5000mAh or higher, with a good C-rating.

This setup will ensure stable voltage and enough current for all your servos, while avoiding overheating or power issues.
