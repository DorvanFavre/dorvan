Adding friction to a servomotor to stabilize oscillations is a common approach. Here are some techniques to add or control friction effectively:

1. **Damping Mechanisms:**  
   - **Viscous Dampers:** These are often used to add controlled friction. They contain a fluid or grease that resists motion and can be tuned to specific damping requirements.
   - **Elastomer Damping:** Rubber or other elastomer materials can provide a consistent damping effect, especially useful for low-frequency oscillations.

2. **Increased Static Friction:**  
   - Applying a **grease or lubricant with higher viscosity** can help create more static friction, reducing oscillations. This can be particularly useful if you have accessible moving parts around the servo’s axis.

3. **Mechanical Brakes:**  
   - Small, adjustable mechanical brakes can apply friction directly to the servo or the load. These might include **disk brakes or band brakes** that you can adjust for just the right amount of resistance.

4. **Torsion Springs or Rubber Bands:**  
   - By attaching a **torsion spring** or rubber band, you can introduce a controlled resistance, which can reduce oscillations while still allowing for smooth motion. 

5. **PID Tuning (Proportional-Integral-Derivative Control):**  
   - If you’re controlling the servo electronically, adjusting the **PID parameters** may help. This can reduce overshooting and oscillations by tuning the response of the servo motor to feedback.
