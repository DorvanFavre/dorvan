These papers should provide a solid foundation for developing your hexapod, covering a range of topics from gait generation to stability and navigation. You can usually find these papers through academic databases like IEEE Xplore, ResearchGate, or Google Scholar.

Yes, several scientific papers and resources focus on the mechanical design aspects of hexapod robots, including leg length, joint positioning, and overall structure. Here are some recommended papers and topics to help you make informed mechanical choices:

1. **Leg Design and Placement**:
   - *"Design and Analysis of Legged Robots with Emphasis on Hexapod Robots"* – This paper covers the principles behind leg positioning, including factors such as leg length, joint placement, and range of motion. It discusses how these aspects affect the robot’s stability, maneuverability, and energy efficiency.

2. **Optimal Leg Configuration for Stability and Mobility**:
   - *"Mechanical Design and Stability Analysis of a Hexapod Robot for Rough Terrain"* – This study investigates optimal leg placement and size based on stability requirements for uneven or unpredictable surfaces. It emphasizes the importance of leg length and position for maintaining a stable center of gravity and improving maneuverability.

3. **Structural Choices for Load Distribution**:
   - *"Design and Structural Analysis of a Hexapod Robot for Improved Load Distribution"* – This paper looks at how different frame geometries and leg placements affect load-bearing capabilities. It provides insights into designing a frame that distributes weight effectively across legs, which is key in hexapod robots where each leg can experience varying loads.

4. **Biomimetic Influences on Leg Design**:
   - *"Biologically Inspired Design of Hexapod Robots for Enhanced Locomotion"* – Inspired by insect anatomy, this paper explains how certain leg lengths, segment proportions, and joint angles mimic efficient walking patterns found in nature. It provides a perspective on how to choose leg configurations that support natural and efficient movement patterns.

5. **Leg Compliance and Flexibility**:
   - *"Designing Compliant Legs for Hexapod Robots: Balancing Flexibility and Stability"* – This research discusses how leg flexibility, including compliant materials and joint damping, influences a hexapod’s stability and adaptability on different surfaces. It’s valuable if you’re considering leg flexibility to absorb shocks and adapt to rough terrain.

6. **Effect of Leg Length and Body Height on Energy Efficiency**:
   - *"Impact of Leg Length and Body Height on Energy Consumption of Hexapod Robots"* – This paper analyzes how different leg lengths and body heights affect energy consumption during locomotion. Shorter legs may require higher energy on rough terrain, while longer legs can improve step reach but require stronger servos or actuators.

If you’re designing a hexapod from scratch, these sources should help you decide on dimensions, joint placement, and structural choices based on real-world performance requirements. Each of these aspects can significantly affect not only the robot’s mechanical stability but also its control complexity and energy needs. You can find these papers in academic journals, robotic conferences, or databases like IEEE Xplore or ScienceDirect.
