Your observation about negative rewards leading to inactivity is common in reinforcement learning. The robot might prefer not to move at all because any action risks worsening the reward. To address this issue and encourage meaningful exploration, you can modify your reward function to balance exploration and goal-seeking behavior.

Here are strategies to improve your reward function:

---

### 1. **Shaped Rewards**

Instead of a strictly negative reward for incorrect movement, provide **shaped rewards** that guide the agent toward the goal:

- **Proximity Reward**: Reward the agent based on the _improvement_ in proximity to the target. For instance:
    
    rt=−Δdistance=(distancet−1−distancet)r_t = -\Delta \text{distance} = (\text{distance}_{t-1} - \text{distance}_{t})
    - This ensures the agent gets positive rewards for moving closer to the target and negative rewards for moving farther away, but it won't punish inactivity because the reward depends on relative change.
- **Angle Alignment**: Add a component to the reward based on how well-aligned the robot is with the target. For example:
    
    rt=kalign⋅(alignment)r_t = k_{\text{align}} \cdot (\text{alignment})
    
    where alignment\text{alignment} is proportional to the cosine of the angle between the robot's direction and the target. This helps the robot learn to orient itself before moving.
    

**Final Reward (Shaped):**

rt=w1⋅(distancet−1−distancet)+w2⋅(alignment)r_t = w_1 \cdot (\text{distance}_{t-1} - \text{distance}_{t}) + w_2 \cdot (\text{alignment})

Choose weights w1w_1 and w2w_2 to balance these terms. For instance, start with w1=1w_1 = 1 and w2=0.1w_2 = 0.1.

### 2. **Reward for Small, Meaningful Steps**

In cases where the agent tends to stop moving, reward even small forward progress. You can do this by providing:

- A **baseline reward** for any forward motion.
- A **penalty for inactivity** to discourage getting stuck: rt={+ϵif distance improves slightly−kinactiveif no movement for N stepsr_t = \begin{cases} +\epsilon & \text{if distance improves slightly} \\ -k_{\text{inactive}} & \text{if no movement for } N \text{ steps} \end{cases} where ϵ\epsilon is a small positive reward, and kinactivek_{\text{inactive}} penalizes stalling.

---

### 3. **Sparse Rewards with Guiding Mechanisms**

If shaping rewards leads to unintended consequences (e.g., the agent gaming the alignment term), you can use sparse rewards for reaching the target and introduce auxiliary mechanisms to guide behavior:

- **Sparse Reward for Success**: Provide a large reward only when the agent reaches the target. rt={+1000if target reached0otherwiser_t = \begin{cases} +1000 & \text{if target reached} \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}
- **Curriculum Learning**: Start with easier targets (closer to the robot) and gradually increase difficulty (farther away).

---

### 4. **Encourage Exploration**

To reduce the risk of local minima, encourage exploration:

- **Entropy Regularization**: Many RL algorithms like PPO include entropy regularization to ensure the policy remains stochastic during learning, encouraging exploration.
- **Intrinsic Rewards**: Use a curiosity-based reward (e.g., novelty of the visited states) to drive exploration: rt=rextrinsic+rintrinsicr_t = r_{\text{extrinsic}} + r_{\text{intrinsic}} where rintrinsicr_{\text{intrinsic}} is high for states the agent has not explored frequently.

---

### 5. **Time-Step Penalty**

To encourage the agent to reach the goal quickly, introduce a small penalty per timestep. This discourages stalling and incentivizes efficient paths:

rt=shaped reward−ktime⋅tr_t = \text{shaped reward} - k_{\text{time}} \cdot t

where ktimek_{\text{time}} is a small penalty per time step, such as −0.01-0.01.

---

### 6. **Adaptive Reward Scaling**

If the reward function is too sensitive to small changes, you can normalize the reward or use adaptive scaling:

- Normalize the distance: rt=1−distancetinitial distancer_t = 1 - \frac{\text{distance}_t}{\text{initial distance}} This ensures that the reward magnitude is consistent across episodes.

---

### Example Reward Function

Here’s an example Python implementation of a shaped reward function:

```python
def compute_reward(robot_position, target_position, prev_distance, current_distance, angle_alignment, steps_without_moving):
    # Distance improvement
    distance_improvement = prev_distance - current_distance
    proximity_reward = 10 * distance_improvement  # Scale distance improvement
    
    # Alignment reward
    alignment_reward = 5 * angle_alignment  # Scale alignment term
    
    # Penalize inactivity
    if steps_without_moving > 5:
        inactivity_penalty = -1
    else:
        inactivity_penalty = 0
    
    # Large reward for reaching target
    distance_to_target = np.linalg.norm(robot_position - target_position)
    if distance_to_target < 0.1:  # Threshold for reaching target
        return 1000  # Large reward for success
    
    # Combine rewards
    reward = proximity_reward + alignment_reward + inactivity_penalty
    return reward
```

### Next Steps

1. Experiment with different combinations of proximity, alignment, and exploration rewards.
2. Monitor the agent's behavior and adjust weights for the reward terms.
3. Use visualization tools to understand how the agent explores the environment and adjust your reward function accordingly.
