Try to make the simulated hexapod walk with the simple CPG implementation from NeuroMechFly. There are different option to try. See which one gives the bests results. 

- CPG on joints value
- CPG on leg coordinated using invert kinematics
- Hard coded CPG parameters to produce tripod gait
- Use RL agent to learn CPG parameters

Going further:
Implement a more complexe CPG network to make Fourier signals.


### Task 1 

- Use invert kinematic so i can use cpg for X and Z axis and leave Y to unchanged. The result is also more comprehensive.
- use a predefined gait. No use of RL.

**Results**
