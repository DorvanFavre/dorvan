To power your NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit using a 2S LiPo battery, you’ll need to step up the voltage to match the Jetson's input requirements. Here’s how you can do it:

### 1. **Understand the Voltage Requirements**

- The Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit typically requires a **5V DC input** for the USB-C power supply or **9-20V DC** for the barrel jack input.

### 2. **Check Your Battery Voltage**

- A **2S LiPo battery** has a nominal voltage of **7.4V** (3.7V per cell) and a fully charged voltage of **8.4V** (4.2V per cell). This is within the acceptable range for the barrel jack input (**9-20V**) but not ideal when the battery discharges below **9V**.

### 3. **Use a DC-DC Step-Up (Boost) Converter**

- To ensure stable operation, you need a **DC-DC step-up converter** that can boost the 2S LiPo voltage to at least **9V**.
- Choose a converter with the following specifications:
    - Input: **6-8.4V** (for 2S LiPo range)
    - Output: **9-12V** (configure to suit your Jetson’s barrel jack input)
    - Output current: At least **3A**, but **5A** or more is better to handle peak loads.

### 4. **Connect the Components**

1. **Battery to DC-DC Converter:**
    - Connect the LiPo battery to the input terminals of the DC-DC converter.
    - Make sure the polarity matches (positive to positive, negative to negative).
2. **Converter to Jetson:**
    - Set the output of the DC-DC converter to **9V** or higher (up to **12V** is fine).
    - Use a **barrel jack cable** to connect the output of the converter to the Jetson’s barrel input.

### 5. **Monitor Power Consumption**

- The Jetson Orin Nano can draw significant power under heavy load. Ensure the battery has enough capacity to handle your usage. For example:
    - If your Jetson consumes an average of **15W**, a **2S 2000mAh LiPo battery** (rated at 7.4V) would last approximately **45 minutes**: Battery runtime (hours)=Battery capacity (mAh) × Battery voltage (V)Device power consumption (W)\text{Battery runtime (hours)} = \frac{\text{Battery capacity (mAh) × Battery voltage (V)}}{\text{Device power consumption (W)}}

### 6. **Safety Considerations**

- Use a **LiPo battery voltage alarm** or a **battery management system (BMS)** to avoid over-discharging the LiPo, which could damage it.
- Ensure proper ventilation to prevent the converter from overheating under high load.
- Test the setup with a multimeter to verify correct voltage and polarity before connecting the Jetson.

### Example Components

- **DC-DC Boost Converter:** XL6009 or MT3608 modules (ensure current capacity matches your needs).
- **Barrel Jack Adapter:** 5.5mm x 2.1mm plug for the Jetson Orin Nano.
